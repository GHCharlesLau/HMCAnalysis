Prioritizing what's urgent or important can help you focus on one thing at a time.    2. Set Boundaries: It’s essential to carve out time for yourself. Make sure to set boundaries between work and personal life to give yourself time to recharge.    3.  Practice Mindfulness: Engaging in mindfulness or meditation can help ground you and reduce stress. Even a few minutes a day can make a difference.    4. Communicate: Don't hesitate to reach out to your friends or family about how you’re feeling. Sharing your concerns can strengthen your relationships and provide you with support.    5.  Take Breaks: Make sure you take regular breaks during work to clear your head. Short walks or stretching can make a big difference in your focus and energy levels.    6.  Plan for the Future: While it’s natural to worry about uncertainty, try to focus on what you can control.
